# What

This is a clone of the Cyan LIght Theme color scheme in JetBrains IDEs

# Why another fork

Because the currently existing **forks are not supported**, they were created a couple of years ago, and the jetbrains theme is several, but is being updated + all the themes in vscode do not accurately recreate the color scheme (I assume this is due to differences in Python syntax highlighting)
